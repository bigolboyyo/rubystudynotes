# Use common comparison methods for control flow (==, !=, >, <)
# Use common operators for control flow (&&, ||, !, ?:)

#FIXME: Conditional operators: Generally in any language this means that you will be running certain code when/if some condition has been met. 

# Comparison Operators

# - ( > ) - Greater than
# - ( >= ) - Greater than OR equal to
# - ( < ) - Less than
# - ( <= ) - Less than OR equal to
# - ( == ) - Equal to
# - ( != ) - NOT equal to

# - ( && ) - Logical and. Are both values truthy?
# - ( || ) - Logical or. Is one or the other value truthy?
# - ( ! ) - not. Coerces the data to its boolean equivalent, then reverses it (true becomes false, and vice versa).

# Ruby also has the ternary operator (?:) for writing an inline conditional statement:
